Noam Chomsky has been a harsh critic regarding the use of statistical methods in understanding human language since the 50's. About 6 years ago, he again re-iterated his stand in a symosium at MIT (you can watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92GOS1VIGxY">here</a>). Peter Norvig, who is another stalwart in the field of Artificial Intelligence analyzed Chomsky's argument to great depth and dismissed a vast majority of his views in a <a href="http://norvig.com/chomsky.html">post</a>.

One of the centeral points that Chomsky makes and that Norvig tries to dismiss is about the "notion of scientific success". For example, a good example of true scientific success, that both agree on  is Newton's discovery of the Gravitational model. Here Chomsky says that newton didn't devise a predictor that takes in some inputs with details of objects and outputs the gravitational force. With some error and that can be iteratively SoTA. Shaata. Illa, Newton en maadthane andre, elegant forualt kodthane. That explains everything. Adu idu:
Newtonian model of gravitational attraction, which says that the force between two objects of mass m1 and m2 a distance r apart is given by
F = G m1 m2 / r2

Now norvig claims that G is trained and calculated. so what netwon did is no different than what we are doign with Deep Ntes. But what norvig misses is this: gravitational law merely states that gra. It says that its just masses and radis. distance. Nothing else. What it is not dependant antha helathalla, adu most imprtatn. constant he knw: he told it was a constant and moved on. It was a constant, nothing else can come into the equation. adu epic studdness.

The gravitational constant appears in Newton's law of universal gravitation, but it was not measured until seventy-one years after Newton's death by Henry Cavendish with his Cavendish experiment, performed in 1798 

Newton was not even interested in this. 

where G is the universal gravitational constant. This is a trained model because the gravitational constant G is determined by statistical inference over the results of a series of experiments that contain stochastic experimental error. It is also a deterministic (non-probabilistic) model because it states an exact functional relationship. I believe that Chomsky has no objection to this kind of statistical model. Rather, he seems to reserve his criticism for statistical models like Shannon's that have quadrillions of parameters, not just one or two.

It is not about number of parameters. Netwon could have said force = sigma constatnts * masses and even with infinite paramters, this would give so much insight than regression,

This is a dear example I have thought a lot about this. This would not help us land rockerts adn mine asteroids. this would only give some short term satisfaction,
